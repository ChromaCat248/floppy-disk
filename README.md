# Floppy disk STL file

A relatively convincing replica floppy disk model.


### Instructions

1. Print with supports and cooling, then cut away the support material.

2. Cut a segment of notebook paper to fit in the label indentation. Use glue or double-sided tape to stick the notebook paper in the indentation.

3. Cut a segment of aluminum foil (aluminum tape would work too) to fit in the other indentation and cut about 1 centimeter off the side. Use glue or double-sided tape to stick the foil into the indentation (not needed for obvious reasons if you use aluminum tape), leaning towards the cut corner.

4. Using a razor knife, cut out a rectangular hole in the aluminum (on the same side as the cut corner on both sides).

5. Cut a segment of aluminum foil (aluminum tape would work too) to fit on the circular island in the middle. Stick it on and cut to shape with a razor knife.

6. Done.
